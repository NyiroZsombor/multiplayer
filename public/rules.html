    <h1>Rules: International checkers</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Starting position</h2>
        <div id="starting-positions">
            <ul>
                <li>The game is played an a 10Ã—10 board chess-like board. The bottom left tiles must be dark just like in chess.</li>
                <li>Each player starts with 20 pieces, all on dark squares, with two rows empty in the middle.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Moves and captures</h2>

    <!-- Example of moves, including notation -->
        <ul>
            <li>The player with the light pieces moves first. Then turns alternate.</li>
            <li>Ordinary pieces move one square diagonally forward to an unoccupied square.</li>
            <li>Capturing can be done by jump over a piece, moving two squares forward or backward. The move with the most captures <em>must</em> be made.</li>
            <li>If, after capturing, the piece lands on a tile where it can capture it, must.</li>
            <li>The captured pieces are only removed after the move.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Crowning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Crowning happens when a piece reaches the far side of the board. In this case the piece is turned into a <em>king</em>.</li>
            <li>Kings can move any number of squares backward or forward.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Winning and draws</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If a player cannot make a legal move, loses. This can either be because they have no pieces left or because they are obstructed.</li>
            <li>The game is a draw if neither of the player can win:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A king-versus-king endgame</li>
                <li>The same position is repeated three times, with the same player having the move</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
